Home Credit Default Risk- Intro

This work is the result of the Data Science specialization course at Digital House Coding School.
Its aim is to find out what the best model to predict credit default risk is, using unconventional variables in order to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population.

It is extremely difficult for some people to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Therefore, using a variety of alternative data - including telco and transactional information – to predict their repayment abilities, will ensure that people capable of repayment are not rejected.

According to the latest World’s Bank Global Findex Database, nearly one-third of adults – 1.7 billion – are still unbanked. Financial inclusion is a key enabler to reducing poverty and boosting prosperity. 

Data used in this work comes from a Kaggle competition.
This work is divided into four sections. Part one consists in data pre-processing, which goes from data quality assessment to feature encoding. Part two is where feature selection is applied. On the third section, the following models are implemented to the data:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision trees (Tree classifier, Random Forest and Extra Tree).

Finally, results are shown in part four.
